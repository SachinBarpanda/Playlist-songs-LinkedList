# Playlist-songs-LinkedList
 
 We're creating a project on linked list based on a playlist of a song.
 
 Linked list:-
 
 Linked list. In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their    
 physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which      
 together represent a sequence.

 
 Question for the Project:-
 
 1.Create a program that implements a playlist for songs
 
 2. Create a Song class having Title and Duration for a song.
 
 3.The program will have an Album class containing a list of songs.
 
 4.The albums will be stored in an ArrayList
 
 5.Songs from different albums can be added to the playlist and will appear in the list in the order
 
 they are added.
 
 6.Once the songs have been added to the playlist, create a menu of options to:-
 
 7.Quit,Skip forward to the next song, skip backwards to a previous song.  Replay the current song.
 
 8.List the songs in the playlist
 
 9.A song must exist in an album before it can be added to the playlist (so you can only play songs that
 
 you own).
 
 10.Hint:  To replay a song, consider what happened when we went back and forth from a city before we
 
 started tracking the direction we were going.
 
 11.As an optional extra, provide an option to remove the current song from the playlist
 
 (hint: listiterator.remove()
